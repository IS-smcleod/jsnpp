INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You only need to copy the jsnpp-x.y.z.jar file to somewhere in your classpath.

BUILDING
~~~~~~~~
JSNPP requires apache ant, http://ant.apache.org, to build.  Once you have
apache ant installed, you can build JSNPP with

$ ant all

This will build the API jar files, examples jar files, and API html
documentation.  The jar files are placed in the lib/ sub-directory, the API
html documentation is placed in the docs/api/ sub-directory.

EXAMPLES
~~~~~~~~
To run the example code, you'll want to build the example

$ ant examples

Then run the example

$ java -cp $CLASSPATH:jsnpp.jar:jsnpp-examples.jar jsnpp.SNPPExample
